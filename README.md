Role of norepinephrine in mediating stress hormone regulation of long-term memory storage: a critical involvement of the amygdala

 The central hypothesisï¼š stress hormones released during emotionally arousing experiences activate noradrenergic mechanisms in the BLA, resulting in enhanced memory for those events. 
 
There is extensive evidence indicating that the noradrenergic system of the amygdala, particularly the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA), is involved in memory consolidation.
